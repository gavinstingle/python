#EX) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.

one = True
two = False
a = one and two 
print(a)

#1) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.

x = True
y = False
a = x or y 
print(a)
#2) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the or operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named b. Print the variable.

w = True
z = True
b = w and a 
print(z)

#3) Make one boolean variable. Put the variable after the not. Store this 
#expression in a variable named c. Print the variable.

g = False
c = not g
print(c)
#4) Make a logical expression with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
#syntax
#not 
#4 < 3 or


#logical
#boolean = (username == "michael") or (password == "mjw11343")
