#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

var1 = "basket"
var2 = "ball"
game = var1 + var2 
print(game)
#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

var3 = 5
var4 = 6
answer = var3 + var4
print(answer)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

var5 = 7
var6 = 8

newAnswer = var5 - var6
print(newAnswer)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

var7 = 2.5
var8 = 3.5

subtract = var7 - var8
print(subtract)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

var9 = 2
var10 = 3
mult = var9 * var10
print(mult)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

color = "red"
amount = 3
paint = color * amount
print(paint)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

var11 = 12
var12 = 2

divide = var11 / var12
print(divide)


#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

var13 = 30.5
var14 = 1.25

divide1 = var13 / var14
print(divide1)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4
y = 3

z = x % y 
print(z)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

i = 5
j = 3
k = i // j 
print(k)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

a = 4
b = 2
c = a ** b 
print(c)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

g = "swag"
print ("Gavin is: " + g)

#print("Gavin is: " + 4)
