#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x = "gavin"
y = "teacher"

z = x == y
print(z)



#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.


x = 4
y = 3

z = x == y 
print(z)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x = 5
y = 6 
z = x > y
print(z)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x = 2
y = 3 
z = x < y
print(z)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x = 7
y = 6
z = x >= y

print(z)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

x = 1
y = 5
z = x <= y 
print(z)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

x = 3
y = 2
#z = c == y 
print(z)
