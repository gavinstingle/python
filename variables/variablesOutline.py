#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

#Integer

a = 5 
a = 4

#Float

a = 3.45
a = 2.1

#String

a = "string"
a = "michael and!@#$%*()_Chokyi"

#Boolean

a = True
a = False 

#List

a = [3, 4, 5, 6]

a = ["stringOne", "stringTwo"]

a = [True, False, True]

a = [1.1, 2.2, 3.3]


#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

a = 5
A = 10

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

name = 4

name = "michael"
#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

gavin = name
print(gavin)

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

house = ["mike", "eric", "joey"]
var = "eric"

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:

var = "gavin"
char = "g"

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(char)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors
